A simple clone of Flappy Bird running on an Arduino Nano and OLED display.

I used these libraries to get the display working:

The flappy bird code was heavily influenced by 'Flappy Bird in 18 Lines Of Code' 
which boils the game down into its elements brilliantly.

There's a few re-usable text routines at the end to help you get a bit more out 
of the built it fonts.
